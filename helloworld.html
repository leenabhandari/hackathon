										<h3> ["excellent condition as described. unlocked model so there's no bloatware. i'm happy with this purchase.", 'my daughter she got gift on her birthday she loves her phone .', 'unlocked s8 will not fully work on att / verizon.  these features are blocked:  hd voice, video calling, volte, and wifi calling features', 'piece of junk!  have to shut phone off to get notifications.  not good for my business.', "excellent phone with incredible battery and it's extremely fast. it comes without all of the carrier bloatware and you still get 90% of all the features. worked perfectly by just inserting my verizon sim card from previous phone without having to go into the store.", "the phone is amazing rather for some rattling that happens when you shake it. the headphones broke shortly after a day of use which is bad specially for $100 headphones, didn't do anything to them, just normal use and they broke.", 'i could not be more happy. this is where i will buy all my devices from here on out.', 'amazon warehouse deal it said used-like new and this is a steal!', "great phone and an amazing unboxing experience. phone came fast and it's truly 100% factory unlocked.", 'great phone, amazing picture quality and battery life. smooth processor and operating system. amazed.', 'very nice smartphone!!! the photos are wonderful! fotos muito boas e aparelho fenomenal!', 'perfect phone', 'phone works on verizon, girl in the store was surprised. great phone!', 'it arrived before the intended date. i love my new cell phone.', 'was wrapped excellently and everything same so neat', 'black screen on arrival. black screen. charge works, the "accessibility" voice talks. but no screen at all. so disappointed!', 'yes works with verizon wireless  one downfall is the speaker you put to your ear is not very loud but the speakerphone is loud !', 'simply amazing.. in love with the product and the customer service !!!', 'pretty cool', 'works with verizon and at&amp;t..; tried both sim cards. no issues. more than likely will work with international sim cards. upgraded from pixel xl plus.', 'good as new', "ordered this device while harvey was ongoing. there was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. arrived within the time frame and amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.<br/><br/>the device was grouped with the case and screen protector that i had ordered, which was very convenient. packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.<br/><br/>overall, the phone is brilliant. sharp display, clear camera images with af. it runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. the bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. it also ships with usb (b to c) and (a to c) adapters, which helps during our transition to usb c type plugs.<br/><br/>the battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. the 3500mah battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like real racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.<br/><br/>the issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.<br/><br/>i would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. it looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. i would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. to all those having second thoughts, i would say: go for it!", "the phones decent. would i buy another galaxy phone no!! the performance is just to jittery. and please don't get me started on the irritating bixby button!! i find myself pushing it all the time on accident. and most of the time it doesn't even pick up what i say. for a 600-850$ phone you'd think it's performance would be better. this was my first galaxy phone and because of it's jittery performance, annoying bixby service and the fact that the phones most likely not getting an update to oreo anytime soon it's most likely going to stay this way!! but don't get me wrong it's still a good phone. it has a gorgeous display, amazing camera loud but not the clearest speaker and super attractive design. but if i was you i would look elsewhere.", 'product was a lemon, within a week out of the box developed touchscreen problems. contacted samsung technical support and was told the only recourse i had was to ship the device out to some nebulous repair facility for approximately 1 month. was acknowledged as a defect yet would still not exchange device for a functional unit without a 1 month turnaround.<br/><br/>i have used galaxy devices from s3-s6 and after this will never purchase another samsung electronic of any variety.', "i purchased this as a surprise for my wife as an upgrade to her existing s4. she was so surprised and happy when it was delivered. she has hardly when wife is happy ... we're all happy!", 'the galaxy s8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  it was a welcome upgrade to my s5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  i hesitated to give samsung another try after so many later problems with the s5.<br/><br/>in the end it was worth the upgrade.  as expected, the s8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the s5.  i have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it\'s hardly worth mentioning.<br/><br/>of note however, is the hoops i had to jump through to get this phone working with verizon.  this review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local verizon store.<br/><br/>this unlocked 64gb phone is perfectly compatible with the verizon network and now is working great; however, the verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a "verizon branded" s8.  do yourself a favor; call verizon tech support to get it figured out.  after almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to verizon tech support resolved everything.<br/><br/>note that this phone takes a mini sim card and can\'t simply be swapped from the s5; this is why i had to endure a trip to the local verizon store at all.<br/><br/>also note; if activating this unlocked phone on verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard verizon voicemail app.  you will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the google app store.  not a big deal; youmail fits the bill just fine for me.<br/><br/>other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked s8 on amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the verizon branded s8.', "it's pretty much iphone x but came out super early.", "i had this phone for about 2 weeks, but i ended up returning it. the camera was really great and took quality photos. i also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. but ultimately i didn't enjoy the samsung skin over android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the oneplus 3. additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. it was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.", 'phone is not unlocked as in you do not have root permission on the phone.<br/>this indicates there are applications (bloat ware) still installed and eating up battery, with potential security holes.<br/>other than that the phone is very good.<br/>absolute must is a big strong case for this phone, it is very fragile.', 'very good. still checking out'] </h3>
